Sub Strings, by Logan Hosoda

Given a string and an array of valid substrings (dictionary), counts and returns each individual substring found in the provided string.

As of right now, this program is limited by the provided 'dictionary' array. More words
would need to be provided to obtain a more robust result. Given the scope of the task,
I'm considering the program complete for the time being.

Additionally, the program currently loops through the entire dictionary array for every
single provided word. This results in a far less than optimal solution to the problem. 

Should I revisit this challenge, I would look into a more robust, and optimal solution.
